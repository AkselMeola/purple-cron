Installing instructions
============================


Navigate to src directory and call make.

% cd src/
% make
% make install

NOTE: Make install just copies the compiled purplecron.so and scripts to your users home directory under .purple/plugins. 

Local testing
============================
% cd src/
% make
% make try

Kills the current pidgin instance and restars it after it has copied the plugin.
This for quickly testing the plugin in action.
